Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry
Software Development is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and toold to develop and maintain high quality software systems. In the tech industry, software engineering has aided in the development of complex and reliable software systems that led to the advancment of fields such as medicine, business among others.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of software languages such as Fortan.
2. The establishment f software engieering as a principle in the 1960s.
3. The development of agile methodologies of software development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements- this involves identifying the specific needs to be addressed.
2. Design- Crafting a high level software plan and its user interphase.
3. Implementation- Writing codes to develop the software according to the laid out plan.
4. Deployement- Releasing the software to the user.
5. Maintenance- creating updates for the software to make it up to date and more reliable.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
WWaterfall methodology refers to a sequential approach in developing a software with distinct phases eg requirements, design, implementantion....
while agile methodology refers to development a prt of a software and then receiving feedback for it before continuing to the next part.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer - responsible for writing the codes that make up a software.
Quality Assurance Engineer - responsible for testing the quality of the software and whether it meets the given priciples of software engineering.
Project Manager - ensures the smooth running of the entire process in software development, from the plannig to when the actual software is delivered.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight Schedules.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - involves testing each module of the software
Intergration testing - tests the compartibility of units and their workablity
System testing - involves testing the entire system as a whole
Acceptance testing - tests whether the software meets the needs of the user

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to the process of crafting questions for AI models so as to get the optimum results. It helps a user in getting the most relevant response from an AI model.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: What is a baobab tree?
Improved propmt: Can you explain in simple and aeay to understand language what a boabab tree is. Explain what it features are and the benefits that can be derived from it. Also include where the tree can be found.
